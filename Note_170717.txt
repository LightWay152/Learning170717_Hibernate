Hibernate

- Remember copy 14 jar lib file to folder lib in WEB-INF
- Remember copy hibernate.cfg.xml file to folder src and cofig info in this
- In configure("hibernate.cfg.xml") should rename is hibernate.cfg.xml, if change this name, 
in hibernate config file must be change the same
- If you see configure(), it's meaning default in () is "hibernate.cfg.xml"

- Database: Create database named Java and run script170717.sql to import database

- In hibernate, if handling and change database, you must use transaction
- Crietia: work with data without write HQL
- Why should use Sql Server tool to combine with hibernate because it's the most difficult

- Table in sql Regardless (không phân biệt) of uppercase, lowercase but entity Distinguish (có phân biệt) of uppercase, lowercase:
+ Class in Eclipse is singular (số ít)
+ Table in Sql Server is plurality (số nhiều)

- Result of HQL query: list of Object array

- Compare get vs load:
+ get: read all of record in database, load data direct form entity, use more memory than use load but query faster
+ load: only read data from database, do not load data direct from entity, use less memory than use load but query slower
